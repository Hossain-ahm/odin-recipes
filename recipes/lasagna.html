    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ah, lasagna! Just the word conjures up images of bubbling, cheesy goodness, layers of savory meat sauce and creamy ricotta, and that satisfyingly soft yet toothsome pasta nestled in between. It's a dish that warms the soul and fills the belly, perfect for a cozy dinner party or a comforting family meal.</p>
    <p>The magic of homemade lasagna lies in its many delicious layers. Imagine golden lasagna noodles, cooked al dente so they're slightly firm yet yielding to the bite. Picture a layer of rich, slow-simmered meat sauce, infused with the عطر of garlic, oregano, and basil, and studded with tender ground beef or sausage. Envision a creamy dollop of ricotta cheese, its mild sweetness perfectly complementing the savory sauce. And finally, imagine a generous sprinkle of shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, melting into gooey, golden rivers as the lasagna bakes.</p>
    <p>Each bite is a symphony of textures and tastes. The soft pasta melds with the creamy ricotta and tangy tomato sauce, while the tender meat offers a satisfying chew. The sharp bite of Parmesan mingles with the mellow mozzarella, and the subtle herbs in the sauce add a touch of complexity.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> ½ pound ground pork and ½ pound lean ground beef, browned and seasoned.</li>

      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the meat:</strong> Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
